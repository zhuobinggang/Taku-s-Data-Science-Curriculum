## TODO

- [ ] What do recurrent neural network gammars learn about syntax? ()

#### VAE

- [ ] 2017 Toward controlled generation of text.  (text style transfer)
- [ ] 2018 Disentangled representation learning for text style transfer. (text style transfer)
- [ ] 2018 Style transfer in text: Exploration and evaluation. (text style transfer)
- [ ] 2018 Syntax-directed variational autoencoder for structured data. (impose context-free grammars (CFGs as hard constraints in the VAE decoder)
- [ ] 2018 A deep generative framework for paraphrase generation.
- [ ] 2018 Syntactic manipulation for generating more diverse and interesting texts.
- [ ] 2017 Grammar variational autoencoder.
